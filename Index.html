			<h2>Origin of Zoos</h2>
			<p>For thousands of years people have held animals in captivity. However the modern concept of a zoo was created by the wealthy to flaunt their wealth. Dating back all the way to 2500 BCE in Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, there are records of ancient people traveling across the world to bring back wild animals. There is also evidence that these animals were taken care of and they were forced to reproduce in order to sustain their lineage. It was not until the Age of Enlightenment (18th Century) that people started to consider reasoning and science as a part of everyday life. In order to study zoology, scientists had to keep animals in small areas that would act as a pseudo habitat.In 1973, after the french revolution, menagerie animals were brought to the first modern day zoo, which is still active today. Nowadays Zoos are for educational purposes and have a deep interest in conserving endangered species. <br>&nbsp;

			<h2>Animal Benefits</h2>
			
			
		  <p>Zoo’s will always be a politically controversial topic. Some people believe they are completely inhumane and that we should abolish them as a whole. This might be true for some of the animals held on these establishments, but for other animals this is not the case. For more than 100,000 years humans have contributed to the rapid extinction of mammals on the planet. Even in the current day there are plenty of species that are going extinct or on the verge of total extinction. These are called endangered animals. <br>

Many people believe letting animals roam the wild is the best thing for them because that is what they were meant for. This is something I agree with but on the other hand we have animals like dogs that have been domesticated over centuries. Even now we have companies that make outfits for dogs as if they’re humans. The truth is we took wolves and bred them into dogs, so the same argument for zoo animals could be made for dogs. Now we keep dogs in our homes, and some people even build dog houses for their pets. Now when it comes to zoo animals, there are certain benefits that they have while being in a zoo. The scientists around them can observe for any diseases and help treat the animals, which would be impossible if they were still in the wild. So for the most part, while some zoos are negligent in handling their animals, many zoos make it their mission to maintain a healthy life for these animals.

			<h2>Human Benefits</h2>	
			Zoo’s provide a lot of educational information for people to learn about. All zoo’s offer pamphlets and bulletin boards full of information about specific animals. This ranges from habitat, types of food they eat, and natural predators. This is good for visitors because it allows people to get a close look at animals they would otherwise never see in their life, and gives them a chance to learn more about their favorite animals. This is extremely popular with children. Elementary, and middle schools will often visit the zoo in an effort to educate students and have a little bit of fun. With more people learning about these wild animals it will encourage more people to help preserve wildlife.
